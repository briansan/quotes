Marcus Aurelius said:
"It isn't manly to be enraged. A real man has strength, courage, and endurance; unlike the angry."
Yet today, grown men grow tantrums over the slightest provocations. Mistaking their unchecked rage for a sign of power, not realizing it's an obvious indicator of weakness.
To the ancient Stoics, power isn't in outbursts, but in control. Not in aggression, but in wisdom.
To them, a real man doesn't react, he responds with clarity. And in doing so, he achieves what every man secretly yearns for; a life of respect and influence.
