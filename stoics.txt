Marcus Aurelius said:
"It isn't manly to be enraged. A real man has strength, courage, and endurance; unlike the angry."
Yet today, grown men grow tantrums over the slightest provocations. Mistaking their unchecked rage for a sign of power, not realizing it's an obvious indicator of weakness.
To the ancient Stoics, power isn't in outbursts, but in control. Not in aggression, but in wisdom.
To them, a real man doesn't react, he responds with clarity. And in doing so, he achieves what every man secretly yearns for; a life of respect and influence.

Marcus Aurelius once said:
"The best revenge is not to be like your enemy."
We often believe that by serving revenge, we regain some kind of dignity and power.
Yet in reality, we're showcasing our weakness, revealing how easily our emotions and actions can be manipulated by others.
For the Stoics, vengeance was not an emotional outburst but a sign that one was externally controlled.
For them, true power doesn't come from how many enemies you've defeated, but from how many battles you've chosen not to fight because they were beneath you.
